Soil aggregate formation is largely driven by microbial activities, and can\\nin-turn influence microbial communities by generating distinct microbial habitats, as well as associated impacts\\non water and nutrient dynamics. We investigated the long-term effects of two fertilizer management strategies\\n(poultry manure compost vs. mineral fertilizer) and biochar amendment (0 vs. 10 t ha[−][1 ] walnut shell biochar,\\n900 [◦]C pyrolysis temperature, by-product of gasification) on soil aggregation, soil organic C, and microbial\\ncommunity dynamics in water-stable aggregate fractions in corn-tomato rotations. Using wet-sieving, soils (0–15\\ncm) were divided into four size fractions: large macroaggregates (2000–8000 μm), small macroaggregates\\n(250–2000 μm), microaggregates (53–250 μm) and silt and clay (<53 μm) for calculation of mean weight\\ndiameter in both 2014 and 2018.

Introduction**\\n\\nSoil aggregation, a frequently overlooked property of agro\\xad\\n\\necosystems, plays many crucial roles: maintaining agricultural produc\\xad\\ntivity, promoting soil C storage, providing habitats for soil biology, and\\nregulating soil water dynamics. Soil water-stable aggregates can\\ncontribute to infiltration and water retention (Karami et al., 2012), help\\ncontrol runoff and erosion, and physically protect soil organic matter\\n(SOM) leading to increased soil C storage (Six et al., 2004). Soil aggre\\xad\\ngate fractions and intra-aggregate pores of different sizes contain\\ndistinct physicochemical properties and thus can provide unique habi\\xad\\ntats for diverse microbial communities (Bach et al., 2018; Bailey et al.,\\n2013; Davinic et al., 2012). Aggregate structure in agricultural soils is\\ninfluenced by a series of factors, including soil biota (both microbes and\\nmacrofauna), plant root growth, soil mineralogy and texture, inorganic\\nbinding agents, and environmental conditions (Six et al., 2004).\\nSoil aggregate structure can help stabilize microbial communities\\nand enhance interactions between microbes (Kuzyakov and Blago\\xad\\ndatskaya, 2015; Raynaud and Nunan, 2014). Meanwhile, soil chemical\\nconditions can drastically change over a short distance in soil (Raynaud\\nand Nunan, 2014). Aggregation contributes to heterogeneity in soils by\\ngoverning oxygen, water and nutrient availability and shapes microbial\\ncommunities living inside or at the interface of aggregates (Briar et al.,\\n2011). Furthermore, soil microbial communities can quickly respond to\\nlocal habitat shifts associated with changes in soil aggregation dynamics\\n(Blaud et al., 2012). A better understanding of the interaction between\\nsoil amendments, soil aggregate dynamics, and aggregate-associated soil\\nmicrobial communities can inform management strategies to enhance\\nsoil biological activity and a range of desired soil functions.\\nMost large-scale agricultural systems have moved away from organic\\namendments with increasing reliance on synthetic fertilizers. Soil\\ndegradation, erosion, and soil organic matter loss are unfortunate con\\xad\\nsequences from the paucity of organic inputs that are common in con\\xad\\nventional agricultural production (Lehman et al., 2015). For this reason,\\na variety of organic amendments such as compost (Diacono and Mon\\xad\\ntemurro, 2011), animal manures (Mikha and Rice, 2004), and biochar\\n(Atkinson et al., 2010) are being considered once again, and studies\\ncomparing their impacts on soils managed with synthetic fertilizer that\\ndominate today are critically needed.\\nSoil organic amendments can enhance soil C storage through mul\\xad\\n\\ntiple mechanisms; these include increasing soil microbial biomass and\\nactivity (Liang et al., 2017), enhancing soil water-stable aggregation\\n(Mpeketula and Snapp, 2019), and introducing recalcitrant C (Smith,\\n2016). Biochar is typically applied only once every few years (Major,\\n2010), while the application of manure-based compost tends to be more\\nfrequent (Larney and Angers, 2012), both to provide sufficient macroand micronutrients for plants (Diacono and Montemurro, 2011) and\\nsupport soil microbial communities (Kuzyakov and Blagodatskaya,\\n2015). Biochar has received considerable attention regarding its po\\xad\\ntential to increase soil carbon pools (Smith, 2016). Biomass feedstock\\ncomposition, pyrolysis conditions and soil properties, such as clay con\\xad\\ntent, can impact biochar stability (Wang et al., 2016b). Relatively higher\\npyrolysis temperatures, longer reaction residence time and slow heating\\nare favorable pyrolysis conditions for generating more recalcitrant\\nbiochar with longer half-life (Leng and Huang, 2018), which was\\nconsidered to have greater potential to increase the stable soil carbon\\npool. Biochar has been observed to have both positive and negative\\npriming effects in both lab and field-scale studies and previous _meta-_\\nanalyses indicated that biochar application commonly induced a rela\\xad\\ntively short-term positive priming effect initially, followed by a negative\\npriming effect (Joseph et al., 2021). Biochar containing labile C boosted\\nsoil microbial activities (Zimmerman et al., 2011) and biochar-induced\\nmicrobial nutrient mining (Zhu et al., 2021) can generate positive\\npriming effects. Biochar can also cause negative priming effects over a\\nlonger time period by substrate switching from biochar labile C to the\\nuse of soil organic carbon (Ventura et al., 2019) and substrate dilution\\n\\n\\n(Whitman et al., 2014). Biochar C/N ratio, pyrolysis time, soil clay\\ncontent, and soil C/N ratio affect the magnitude of the negative priming\\neffect (Ding et al., 2018).\\nUnder field conditions, biochar particles experience a decrease in\\ntheir bioavailablity through association with clay particles and soil\\norganic matter (Lehmann and Joseph, 2015). However, biochar surface\\nfunctional groups may become exposed during its aging, which would\\nthen increase biochar-microbe interactions (Wang et al., 2020). Unlike\\nhighly recalcitrant biochar, compost and cover crops contain a higher\\nvariety and concentration of biologically-available nutrients that can be\\nmetabolized by microbes (Diacono and Montemurro, 2010). Soil waterstable aggregate dynamics driven largely by soil microbes play an\\nessential role in soil C sequestration (Joseph C Blankinship et al., 2016).\\nIn a meta-analysis, Islam et al. (2021) reported that biochar properties,\\nsoil and environmental conditions all contributed to the impact of bio\\xad\\nchar on soil aggregation, while wood-sourced and high-temperature\\nbiochar were found to have the greatest effect on aggregation. The\\nlong-term effects of the combined application of compost and biochar on\\nsoil water-stable aggregate dynamics and C sequestration under field\\nconditions remain understudied, especially in annual Mediteranean\\nagroecosystems.\\nThe objective of our study was to investigate the effects of two fer\\xad\\n\\ntiliser treatments, namely poultry manure compost and mineral fertil\\xad\\nizer, each with and without biochar, on soil water-stable soil\\naggregation, aggregate-associated C storage, and soil microbial com\\xad\\nmunity composition and abundance. We hypothesized that: (1) annual\\ncompost addition will increase soil C storage, (2) one-time highly\\nrecalcitrant biochar-C input will increase soil C storage, (3) multiple and\\ncontinuous compost addition will increase soil microbial biomass in bulk\\nsoil and alter microbial community composition across aggregate frac\\xad\\ntions, and (4) compost amendments will increase soil aggregation and\\nassociated soil C storagecompared tounamended soil receiving only\\nmineral fertilizer. To test these hypotheses, we compared the impacts of\\ndifferent fertility management practices and biochar amendment in a 6year tilled, row crop field trial in northern California, representative of\\nan annual Mediterranean agroecosystem.\\n\\n**2. Material and methods**\\n\\n_2.1. Long-term field trial setup_\\n\\nThe field site is located at the Russell Ranch Sustainable Agricultural\\nResearch Facility, University of California, Davis (Davis, California,\\nUSA; 38[◦]32[′]47[′′]N 121[◦]52[′]28[′′]W). The region has a Mediterranean\\nclimate characterized by dry arid summers and wet winters. The soil is a\\nRincon silty clay loam (fine, smectitic, thermic Mollic Haploxeralfs, 20%\\nsand, 49% silt, and 31% clay; 11 g C kg[−][1]C content; 1.30 g cm[−][3 ] bulk\\ndensity).\\nA field experiment was initiated in May of 2012 to investigate the\\nimpacts of soil amendments (poultry manure compost, biochar, and\\nmineral fertilizer) on soil aggregation, C storage, and microbial com\\xad\\nmunities in aggregate size fractions. The field was kept fallow for 10\\nyears before 2012, except for a season of Montezuma oats grown be\\xad\\ntween October 2009 and March 2010. The cropping system consisted of\\na 2-yr rotation of processing tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.)\\nand corn (Zea mays L.). The farm management was based on practices\\nand equipment similar to that used by local commercial growers. Bio\\xad\\nchar was applied once to half of the plots at the start of the experiment at\\na rate of 10 Mg ha[−][1 ] and disked in to a depth of 15 cm. The applied\\nbiochar was a by-product of gasification (pyrolysis temperature of\\n900 [◦]C) derived from walnut shells and produced by Dixon Ridge Farms\\nin Winters, CA (with 57.5 m[2 ]g[−][1 ]surface area, 40.4% ash content, 33.4\\ncmol g[−][1 ]cation exchange capacity, pH of 9.7, 55.3 wt% C, 0.47 wt% N,\\n0.89 wt% H, 1.6 wt% O, 0.64 wt% PO4-P, 9.32 wt% K; see Mukome et al.\\n(2013) for details). Additionally, two fertility management systems were\\ntested with equivalent total N inputs, based on either: i) mineral\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nfertilizer (27.6 kg N ha[−][1 ]as urea-ammonium-nitrate 32 (UAN-32), 36.2\\nkg P ha[−][1]P as phosphorus pentoxide, 17.2 kg K ha[−][1 ]as potassium oxide,\\nand 1.7 kg ha[−][1 ] of zinc chelate as starter fertilizer applied before\\nplanting each season; UAN-32 was applied at a rate of 134.5 kg N ha[−][1 ]\\n\\nthree weeks after tomato transplanting and at a rate of 207.4 kg N ha[−][1 ]\\n\\nat the four-leaf growth stage in corn), or ii) poultry manure compost\\n(8.97 Mg ha[−][1 ]applied yearly, adding on average 225.4 kg ha[−][1 ]total N,\\n119.5 kg ha[−][1 ] total P, and 155.4 kg ha[−][1 ] total K; including an incor\\xad\\nporated winter cover crop for the first four years) (Griffin et al., 2017).\\nThis resulted in four treatments: 1) mineral fertilizer without biochar; 2)\\nmineral fertilizer with biochar; 3) compost without biochar; and 4)\\ncompost with biochar, arranged in a randomized complete block design\\nwith four replicate blocks per treatment and one treatment replicate per\\nblock, making a total of 16 plots (Fig. S1). Each replicate plot was 4.6 m\\nwide and 50 m long.\\nThe average annual above-ground C input in the mineral fertilizer\\ntreatment without biochar was 4.30 Mg C ha[−][1 ]year[−][1 ]as crop residue.\\nBased on calculations for the adjacent Century Experiment at Russell\\nRanch that includes crop rotations with identical compost and cover\\ncrop management, the compost without biochar treatment received an\\naverage annual input of 7.27 Mg C ha[−][1 ]year[−][1 ]for the first 4 years and\\n6.52 Mg C ha[−][1 ]year[−][1 ]for the remaining duration of the experiment, of\\nwhich approximately 2.22 Mg C ha[−][1 ]year[−][1 ]was accounted for by the\\ncompost amendment (Tautges et al., 2019). The biochar-amended\\ntreatments both received 5.53 Mg C ha[−][1 ]as biochar-C (only in Year 1)\\nin addition to the carbon inputs above.\\n\\n_2.2. Soil water-stable aggregate analysis_\\n\\nWater-stable aggregates were separated by size using a wet-sieving\\nmethod adapted from (Elliott, 1986). In March 2014 and March 2018,\\nthree soil sub-samples were taken to a depth 15 cm from each field\\nreplicate using a soil knife and combined into a single representative soil\\nsample. The field-moist soils were passed through an 8 mm sieve by\\ngently breaking the soil clods by hand along natural planes of weakness.\\nA 50 g sample of the moist, 8 mm sieved soil was then submerged in\\ndeionized water (at room temperature) on top of a 2000 μm sieve for 5\\nmin. The sieve was then moved up and down (~3 cm) for 2 min (50\\nrepetitions min[−][1]). The soil and water passing through the sieve were\\ntransferred by gently rinsing the material with deionized water onto the\\nnext smaller size sieve, and the same sieving procedure was repeated.\\nThree sieve sizes (2000 μm, 250 μm and 53 μm) were used to generate\\nfour aggregate size fractions: 1) > 2000 μm (large macroaggregates); 2)\\n250–2000 μm (small macroaggregates); 3) 53–250 μm (micro\\xad\\naggregates); 4) < 53 μm (silt and clay fraction). Two independent rounds\\nof sieving were performed. First, one set of samples were obtained to\\nquantify water-stable aggregates and conduct physicochemical analyses,\\nin which all the aggregate fractions retained on each sieve were rinsed\\noff the sieve in pre-weighed aluminum pans, oven-dried at 60 [◦]C, and\\nthen weighed. The other set of samples was obtained for analysis of\\nmicrobial community composition and abundance. The large and small\\nmacroaggregates and microaggregates retained on each sieve were\\nrinsed off the sieve into sterile 50 mL polypropylene tubes. The silt and\\nclay fraction was allowed to settle for a few minutes, and then sub\\xad\\nsamples of both sediment and supernatant were collected in a 50 mL\\nsterile tube. All the aggregate size fractions were immediately stored at\\n−80 [◦]C until DNA extraction.\\nMean weight diameter (MWD), an index of aggregate stability based\\non a weighted average of the four aggregate size classes, was calculated\\naccording to the following equation (Van Bavel, 1950):\\nwhere Pi is the weight percentage of the fraction in the whole soil and\\nSi is the average diameter (μm) for particles in its fraction.\\n\\n_2.3. C content and its change over time_\\n\\nThe C content of bulk soils and of each aggregate size fraction was\\n\\n\\nanalyzed using a PDZ Europa ANCA-GSL elemental analyzer interfaced\\nto a PDZ Europa 20–20 isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Sercon Ltd.,\\nCheshire, UK) at the UC Davis Stable Isotope Facility.\\n\\n_2.4. Soil dissolved organic C and microbial biomass C_\\n\\nThe fresh soil collected in March 2018 was also used to evaluate the\\nimpacts of different soil management treatments on soil dissolved\\norganic C and soil microbial biomass-C. A representative bulk soil\\nsample (8 g) was mixed with 40 mL 0.5 mol L[−][1 ] potassium sulfate in\\npolypropylene tubes and placed on an orbital shaker (250 rev min[−][1], 30\\nmin). After shaking, samples were centrifuged (relative centrifugal force\\nof 7969 × g for 15 min) to remove suspended solids. Supernatant so\\xad\\nlutions were retained for dissolved organic C concentrations (mg L[−][1]).\\nThe total microbial biomass-C was measured by chloroform fumigation\\n(Joergensen, 1996; Yang et al., 2016). Both soil dissolved organic C and\\nmicrobial biomass-C were measured using a TOC analyzer (Shimadzu\\nTOC-VCSH analyzer, Kyoto, KYT, Japan).\\n\\n_2.5. Soil DNA extraction from aggregate fractions and amplicon_\\n_sequencing_\\n\\nDNA from each soil aggregate size fraction was extracted using the\\nPowerlyzer PowerSoil DNA Isolation kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD,\\nUSA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The extracted DNA\\nwas quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit (Life Technologies,\\nCarlsbad, CA, USA). The V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S\\nrRNA gene was amplified from each sample in duplicate using the\\nprimer pair 505F/816R (Caporaso et al., 2012), which was designed to\\ninclude Illumina adaptors and 12 bp barcode sequences. The resulting\\namplicons were inspected by gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel,\\nquantified by fluorimetry as above, pooled in equimolar concentrations,\\nand sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform (paired-end 250 bp) at the\\nUC Davis DNA Technologies core facility. The raw reads were processed\\nusing DADA2 (Callahan et al., 2016) implemented in R v.3.4.4. Briefly,\\npaired-end fastq files were processed by quality-trimming forward and\\nreverse reads to 190 and 150 bp lengths, respectively. After sequence\\ndereplication, merging, error-correction, and chimera removal, Exact\\nSequence Variants (ESVs) were inferred and taxonomy was assigned\\nusing the SILVA database v. 132. After quality control, the number of\\nsequences per sample varied from 14,596 to 44,786, with an average of\\n28,724. The resulting ESV abundance table was rarified to 14,000 se\\xad\\nquences per sample to ensure equal sampling depth for statistical anal\\xad\\nysis. The Functional Annotation of Prokaryotic Taxa (FAPROTAX)\\npipeline (Louca et al., 2016) was used to predict the functional potential\\nof bacterial taxa identified in our dataset. Raw sequences were deposited\\nat the NCBI sequence read archive (SRA) under BioProject accession\\nnumber PRJNA644905.\\n\\n_2.6. Quantitative PCR_\\n\\nTo assess prokaryotic and fungal gene copy number as a proxy for\\nabsolute abundance, quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed on each\\nDNA sample using the universal primers 515F (5[′]GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3[′]) and 806R (5[′]-GGAC\\xad\\n\\nTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3[′]) for the 16S rRNA gene (Rubin et al., 2014)\\nand ITS1F (5[′]-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA-3[′]) and ITS2 (5[′]GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC-3[′]) for the fungal Internal Transcribed\\nSpacer (ITS) region (De Beeck et al., 2014). qPCR was performed in 20\\nμL reaction mixtures containing 10 μL SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR\\nGreen Supermix (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA), 0.5 μM each primer, and\\n10 ng sample DNA. Reactions were carried out on a BioRad CFX Connect\\nSystem (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA) and amplification of the 16S rRNA\\ngene consisted of an initial denaturation of 95 [◦]C for 3 min, followed by\\n39 cycles of 95 [◦]C for 10 s and 60 [◦]C for 30 s. Amplification of the ITS\\nregion consisted of an initial denaturation of 95 [◦]C for 3 min, followed\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nby 39 cycles of 95 [◦]C for 10 s, 50 [◦]C for 30 s, and 72 [◦]C for 10 s.\\nQuantification was performed by comparing unknown samples to a\\nstandard curve (ranging from 10[2]-10[9 ] copies for 16S rRNA; 10[1]-10[8 ]\\n\\ncopies for ITS) generated with the pCR Blunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen,\\nCarlsbad, CA, USA) containing a PCR-amplified fragment of each target.\\nR[2 ] values for the standard curves ranged from 0.982 to 0.986 and\\n0.991–0.994 for the 16S rRNA gene and ITS region, respectively. Trip\\xad\\nlicate reactions were performed for each target per sample, and a\\nmelting curve analysis was performed after each assay to ensure speci\\xad\\nficity of the amplified products. The abundance of total 16S rRNA and\\nITS were normalized as copies per gram of soil aggregate fraction.\\n16S rRNA and ITS abundances of the bulk soil were estimated based\\non soil aggregation and copy numbers according to the following\\nequation:\\nwhere is the copy number of the target for each soil aggregate frac\\xad\\n\\ntion, and Pi is the weight percentage of the soil aggregate fraction in the\\nwhole soil, respectively, as above.\\n\\n_2.7. Statistical analyses_\\n\\nAll soil physicochemical data were analyzed in Microsoft Excel for\\nWindows 2010 with XLSTAT Version 2019.1 (Addinsoft, 2019) and\\nwere tested for assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance.\\nStatistically significant differences between treatments were analyzed\\nusing a mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) with biochar and\\nfertility management considered as fixed effects and block was a random\\neffect followed by a Tukey’s range test. Statistical analyses were per\\xad\\nformed seperately for years 2014 and 2018 to avoid the potential con\\xad\\nfounding effects of soil moisture on the soil aggregation results and other\\nresults associated with aggregate fractions.\\nNon-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) plots were generated\\nbased on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities to visualize differences in bacterial\\ncommunity composition from our 16S rRNA sequences. Differences in\\nbacterial community composition were tested by permutational multi\\xad\\nvariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) with the ‘adonis’ function\\n(Oksanen et al., 2007) in R v.3.4.4 using Bray-Curtis dissimilarities and\\nmanagement practice, biochar treatment, and aggregate size fraction as\\npredictor variables. All other microbial data, including FAPROTAX\\ncounts and qPCR values were tested for assumptions of normality and\\nhomogeneity of variance before performing ANOVA and a Tukey HSD\\npost-hoc test to identify significant differences between treatments, with\\nbiochar and fertility management considered as main effects, block\\nincluded as a random variable and aggregate fractions nested within\\n\\n\\neach plot replicate. Natural log transformations were applied to meet the\\nassumptions of ANOVA (normality, homoscedasticity) when necessary.\\nFor all analyses, statistically significant differences were defined at P <\\n0.05.\\n\\n**3. Results**\\n\\n_3.1. Soil water-stable aggregates_\\n\\nCompost amended soil had significantly higher aggregate stability\\ncompared to mineral fertilizer treatments after six years, such that in\\nMarch 2018, the MWD of soils managed with compost was 140% higher\\nthan those receiving mineral fertilizer (Fig. 1). Compost application\\nmaintained water-stable aggregation, in which the soil MWD in March\\n2018 remained the same as that in March 2014, while the mineral fer\\xad\\ntilizer treatments significantly decreased by ~48% over the four years\\n(Fig. 1). The observed loss in aggregation under mineral fertilizer was\\nprimarily due to a significant loss in large macroaggregates (Table 1).\\nNeither fertility management nor biochar amendment had a significant\\nshort-term (two years, in March 2014) effect on soil structure (Fig. 1a).\\nBiochar amendment had no long-term effect on soil MWD under either\\nfertilizer treatment (Fig. 1b).\\n\\n_3.2. Soil C content and C in aggregate fractions_\\n\\nCompost application resulted in significantly higher bulk soil C\\ncontent compared to the mineral fertilizer treatment. After six years of\\ncompost amendment in 2018, the C content in the top 15 cm of soil was\\n12.4 g C kg[−][1]whole soil, which was 17% higher than the mineral fer\\xad\\ntilizer treatment (Fig. 2) and due largely to an increase in the large\\nmacroaggregate associated C (Table 2). This was in contrast to early in\\nthe trial, where two years of compost addition did not significantly affect\\nbulk soil C content in 2014 (Fig. 2a). Surprisingly, the 10 Mg ha[−][1 ]\\n\\nbiochar amendment had no long-term effect on soil C content or C dis\\xad\\ntribution across aggregate fractions under either fertility management\\npractice after six years (Fig. 2 and Table 2).\\n\\n_3.3. Soil dissolved organic C and microbial biomass-C_\\n\\nCompost addition significantly increased both soil dissolved organic\\nC and soil microbial biomass C compared to the mineral fertilizer\\ntreatment. Soil dissolved organic C contents in compost treatments were\\n174.6 mg C kg[−][1 ]in the whole soil after 6 years, which was 54% higher\\n\\n\\n**Fig. 1.

Similar differences were\\nalso observed in soil microbial biomass C, which was 315.2 mg C kg[−][1 ]\\n\\nwhole soil in compost, approximately two times as in mineral fertilizer\\ntreatments (Fig. 3b). Similar to total soil C, dissolved organic C and\\nmicrobial biomass C were not influenced by an initial application of\\nbiochar under either treatment in 2018.\\n\\n_3.4. Soil microbial community composition and abundance in water-_\\n_stable aggregate fractions_\\n\\nCompost management significantly increased both bacterial 16S\\nrRNA gene and fungal ITS abundances across soil water-stable aggregate\\nfractions, while biochar had no effect in year 2018 (Figs. 4 and 5). The\\nweighted average gene abundance in bulk soil also indicated that the\\nabundance of the 16S rRNA gene was 76% higher under compost than in\\nsoils receiving mineral fertilizer (Fig. 6a). The weighted average ITS\\ncopy number in bulk soil under compost addition was two orders of\\nmagnitudes higher than in soil under mineral fertilizer treatment\\n(Fig. 6b). Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis of the\\n16 s rRNA gene at the ESV level revealed that soil prokaryotic com\\xad\\nmunity composition was significantly distinct in aggregate fractions of\\ndifferent sizes (Fig. 7). These differences were reflected by higher pro\\xad\\nportions of bacteria from the orders _Micrococcales,_ _Streptomycetales,_\\n_Propionibacteriales, and Sphingomonadales in the microaggregate and silt_\\nand clay fractions, and higher proportions of the _Gaiellales,_ _Gemmati\\xad_\\n_monadales,_ _Nitrososphaerales, and_ _Nitrospirales_ in the large and small\\naggregate fractions. Across all aggregate size fractions, both compost\\nand mineral fertilizer treatments had significant but limited effects on\\nbacterial community composition, whereas biochar had no effect\\n(Fig. S2).\\nPredictive assignment of soil microbial functions based on the 16S\\nrRNA gene sequencing results revealed that the abundance of bacteria\\npotentially capable of degrading aromatic C compounds was higher in\\ncompost than mineral fertilizer treatments in 2018 (Fig. 8). No differ\\xad\\nences were detected for predicted functions related to many major C\\n(methanotrophy, methylotrophy, chitinolysis, cellulolysis, xylanolysis,\\nnon-methane aliphatic hydrocarbon degradation, hydrocarbon degra\\xad\\ndation) and N (aerobic ammonia oxidation, aerobic nitrite oxidation,\\nnitrification, nitrate reduction, ureolysis) cycling pathways between the\\ntwo treatments.\\n\\n\\n**4. Discussion**\\n\\n_4.1. Impacts of external C inputs on soil C storage_\\n\\nOur findings suggest that continuous compost application is more\\neffective at increasing soil C sequestration by maintaining soil structure\\nand stabilizing SOM than in soils not receiving compost. In contrast,\\nwithout compost inputs, there were significant decreases in aggregate\\nstructure, which in turn was associated with significant C loss. Poultry\\nmanure compost is rich in multivalent ions, such as Ca and P (Griffin\\net al., 2017), which can generate a bridging effect to enhance sorption of\\nSOM to clay minerals (Feng et al., 2005) and increase soil aggregation\\n(Bronick and Lal, 2005). The lack of sufficient C input and associated\\naggregate structure in the mineral fertilizer treatments could lead to\\ngreater exposure and more rapid decay of native SOM (Dungait et al.,\\n2012).\\nSurprisingly, walnut shell biochar had little effect on soil C in the top\\n15 cm. Previous research has hypothesized that recalcitrant C com\\xad\\npounds are the major contributors to C sequestration from biochar\\n(Cheng et al., 2008; Harvey et al., 2012), especially high-temperature\\nbiochars like the type applied in our study, which has a high propor\\xad\\ntion of recalcitrant to labile C (Zimmerman, 2010). The O/C and H/C\\natom ratios of the walnut shell biochar were 0.0217 and 0.193,\\nrespectively (Mukome et al., 2013a), which indicated that the walnut\\nshell biochar-C was relatively stable and potentially had a longer than\\n1000-year half-life (Spokas, 2010). A large amount of biochar particles\\n(with a diameter of around 2–4 mm) was easily observed and recovered\\nin the surface soil at the end of the field trial. We did not detect soil bulk\\nC content difference between no-biochar and biochar-amended treat\\xad\\nments under the same management practice in either year 2 or year 6\\n(Fig. 2), which indicated a positive priming effect at the beginning of the\\nfield trial. The walnut shell biochar was high in potassium ion (Mukome\\net al., 2013b). The increase in soil monovalent ion concentration can\\nenhance mobility of soluble SOM and dispersion of organic matter and\\nclay particles (Chow et al., 2006), which can both result in a short-term\\npositive priming effect due to increased microbial available substrates\\nand microbial activities (DeCiucies et al., 2018). A 14-month lab incu\\xad\\nbation study using similar soil and the same biochar (with application\\nrates equivalent or doubled as in the field study) also showed evidence of\\npositive priming effect and potential soil native organic C loss within the\\ntimeframe of the incubation (Wang et al., 2017). Additionally, we\\nspeculate that in the field, some biochar particles may migrate from the\\npoint of application and leave the surface soil through irrigation, wind\\n\\n\\n**Fig. 3.

Interactions between agricultural management, soil structure and soil_\\n_aggregate-associated microbial communities_\\n\\nOur findings suggest that continuous compost addition can poten\\xad\\n\\ntially generate a positive feedback loop for enhancing soil C storage by\\nincreasing microbially-available substrates, in turn increasing and\\nmaintaining soil microbial biomass, and thereby increasing aggregation\\nthrough microbial activities.

Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis of soil microbial communities with ESVs (triangles indicated samples from mineral fertilizer treat\\xad**\\nments, circles indicated samples from compost treatments) after 6 years (March 2018). Different colors and symbols represent different water-stable aggre\\xad\\ngate fractions.\\n\\n\\ncompost-amended than mineral fertilizer treatments. Compost also\\ncontains a diverse range of C sources for soil microbes (Barker, 1997),\\nand its addition helped maintain higher soil labile C (Fig. 3a) and mi\\xad\\ncrobial biomass (Fig. 3b) compared to in the mineral fertilizer treat\\xad\\nments. The compost-induced increase in soil microbial biomass also\\ncorroborated our findings of increased 16S rRNA gene and ITS copy\\nnumbers across aggregate size fractions (Figs. 4 and 5) and in weighted\\nbulk soil averages (Fig. 6). Compost amendment enhanced soil aggre\\xad\\ngation by providing a large amount of labile C (Amlinger et al., 2003) as\\nfeedstock for microbes to produce extracellular polymeric substances,\\nwhich can serve as binding agents for soil aggregates (J C Blankinship\\net al., 2016; Miltner et al., 2012). The increased fungal biomass (Figs. 5\\nand 6) can also promote soil aggregation by binding and entangling soil\\nparticles to form macroaggregate structure (Van Der Heijden et al.,\\n2006). Enhanced soil aggregation provides more diverse habitats for\\norganisms, which can lead to increases in soil microbial diversity (Briar\\net al., 2011). Furthermore, the soil aggregate structure can enhance the\\ninteractions within microbial consortia responsible for metabolizing\\n\\n\\ncomplex organic compounds (Wilpiszeski et al., 2019). The shift we\\nobserved in bacterial communities in different aggregate size fractions\\n(Fig. 7) provides evidence for the paradigm that unique aggregate mi\\xad\\ncroenvironments can provide niches to support the development of\\ndistinct microbial communities, which can further benefit soil and\\necosystem properties (Bach et al., 2018; Wilpiszeski et al., 2019).\\nAcross all aggregate size fractions, we also observed distinct differ\\xad\\n\\nences in prokaryotic community compositions between compost and\\nmineral fertilizer treatments (Fig. S2). Previous research investigating a\\nsimilar soil (Yolo silt loam) from a field adjacent to this trial indicated\\nthat the dissolved organic matter from the soil in our field trial was\\nhighly aromatic (Wang et al., 2016a). Our FAPROTAX predictive results\\nalso indicated a higher abundance of bacteria potentially capable of\\ndegrading aromatic C compounds in compost treatments (Fig. 8), which\\nsuggests that microbial communities under continuous compost appli\\xad\\ncation are potentially capable of utilizing a wider range of C sources\\nfrom both soil amendments and native soil organic matter, which further\\nenriched soil microbially-available nutrients. Such feedback can\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Fig. 8.

Other soil C and N cycling pathways did not show\\ndifferences since the sampling time was 300 days after the yearly\\ncompost amendment.\\nCompost application may have increased macroaggregate formation\\nby maintaining higher fungal populations across aggregate fractions.\\nAlthough both bacteria and fungi populations were higher in the\\ncompost than mineral fertilizer treatments (Figs. 5 and 6), the difference\\nin fungal abundance was two orders of magnitudes higher in compost\\nthan mineral fertilizer treatments (Fig. 6b). Higher fungal biomass\\ndensity has been linked with increased soil aggregate formation (Leh\\xad\\nmann et al., 2020) and fungi have been suggested to contribute more\\nthan prokaryotic communities to macroaggregate formation due to the\\nenmeshing properties of their hyphae (Lehmann et al., 2017). The major\\ndifference in aggregation between the mineral fertilizer and compost\\ntreatments was due to the loss of large-macroaggregates under mineral\\nfertilizer (Table 1), which suggested that the differences in fungal\\ncommunity abundance could have been a major contributor to the\\nobserved differences in soil structure. Similar to our finding, Li et al.\\n(2019) in a long-term field study in Guizhou, China, reported that soil\\nfungal abundances across aggregate fractions were maintained when\\nmineral fertilizer was supplemented with manure but decreased in the\\nabsence of amendments; aggregate-associated C content also declined.\\nIncreased macroaggregate structure in compost treatments can, in turn,\\nenhance the resistance of soil microbial habitats to environmental dis\\xad\\nturbances (Rillig et al., 2017). Our results support the hypothesis that\\nimpacts of management practices on soil C are dependent on changes in\\nsoil aggregation and aggregate-associated microbial communities\\n(Trivedi et al., 2017). As shown in Table S1 and summarized in Griffin\\net al. (2017), despite the benefits associated with soil aggregation and C\\ndynamics, crop yield in compost treatments were significantly lower\\nthan those in mineral fertilizer treatments due to the uncertainty of ni\\xad\\ntrogen availability in compost amended soil and the asynchronous ni\\xad\\ntrogen supply and demand, which is a common tradeoff for similar\\npractices (Seufert et al., 2012).\\nInterstingly, we found no effect of walnut shell biochar on soil\\n\\n\\nmicrobial community composition or any soil parameters in our study,\\nunlike what has been observed in previous studies investigating at other\\ntypes of biochar (Jiang et al., 2016; Khodadad et al., 2011; Zhu et al.,\\n2019). This may be due to the differences in biochar feedstock, pyrolysis\\nconditions, soil and other environmental factors, or the fact that biochar\\nunder field conditions behaves differently than in the lab (Islam et al.,\\n2021). It is possible that biochars produced at high temperatures\\n(900 [◦]C) contain little labile organic C compared to low temperature\\nbiochar and hence are not capable of supporting growth of microbial\\npopulations. Another explanation for the lack of impact may be the\\nlimited accessibility of biochar pores to microbes, despite its relatively\\nhigh surface area and pore volume (Mukome et al., 2013a). The inter\\xad\\nparticle pore structure in biochar is rapidly filled by soil particles after\\naddition to soil (Lehmann and Joseph, 2015). Joseph et al. (2010) found\\nthat biochar internal pores started to fill in with organic and mineral\\nmatter after 1 year and most pores were filled 2 years after application in\\na field experiment. Ameloot et al. (2014) also found that biochar stopped\\nserving as microbial substrate soon after application (~60 days) and had\\nlittle long-term impact on soil microbial biomass and activities under\\nfield conditions. While previous studies have shown that biochar can\\nalter soil microbial communities and potentially increase microbial in\\xad\\nteractions, most of these studies have been conducted in highly weath\\xad\\nered oxisols with limited impacts observed in soils with high fertility (Yu\\net al., 2018). We speculate that soil amendments with higher amounts of\\nnon-pyrolyzed and/or microbially-available organic C can help achieve\\nagricultural management targets, such as enhancing soil aggregation\\nand C storage more effectively.\\n\\n**5. Conclusion**\\n\\nOur findings indicate that continuous compost amendment can\\npotentially generate a positive feedback loop for soil aggregate forma\\xad\\ntion and associated C storage by maintaining higher dissolved organic C\\ncontent, increasing microbial biomass, and supporting largemacroaggregate formation. These processes, in turn, promote the abil\\xad\\nity of the microbial community to utilize more diverse C sources. In finetextured soil, biochar had a limited impact on the soil microbial\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\ncommunity, soil aggregation, and C dynamics, likely due to low mi\\xad\\ncrobial available C and limited interaction with the environment. Longterm continuous diversified C source amendment, such as adding\\ncompost, could be an effective agricultural management practice to not\\nonly maintain but increase soil microbial biomass, aggregate formation,\\nand soil C storage, and also replace some mineral fertilizer which could\\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with fertilizer production.\\nAn integrated management practice that carefully balances compost and\\nmineral fertilizer composition can potentially balance the benefits and\\ntradeoffs.\\n\\n**Declaration of Competing Interest**\\n\\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial\\ninterests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence\\nthe work reported in this paper.\\n\\n**Data availability**\\n\\nData will be made available on request.\\n\\n**Acknowledgments**\\n\\nWe thank Israel Herrera, Deirdre Griffin-LaHue, Nicole Tautges,\\nmembers of the Scow Soil Microbial Ecology Lab, and staff at Russell\\nRanch Sustainable Agriculture Facility in University of California, Davis,\\nfor their valuable support in our field study.

Introduction**\\n\\nSoil aggregation, a frequently overlooked property of agro\\xad\\n\\necosystems, plays many crucial roles: maintaining agricultural produc\\xad\\ntivity, promoting soil C storage, providing habitats for soil biology, and\\nregulating soil water dynamics. Soil water-stable aggregates can\\ncontribute to infiltration and water retention (Karami et al., 2012), help\\ncontrol runoff and erosion, and physically protect soil organic matter\\n(SOM) leading to increased soil C storage (Six et al., 2004). Soil aggre\\xad\\ngate fractions and intra-aggregate pores of different sizes contain\\ndistinct physicochemical properties and thus can provide unique habi\\xad\\ntats for diverse microbial communities (Bach et al., 2018; Bailey et al.,\\n2013; Davinic et al., 2012). Aggregate structure in agricultural soils is\\ninfluenced by a series of factors, including soil biota (both microbes and\\nmacrofauna), plant root growth, soil mineralogy and texture, inorganic\\nbinding agents, and environmental conditions (Six et al., 2004).\\nSoil aggregate structure can help stabilize microbial communities\\nand enhance interactions between microbes (Kuzyakov and Blago\\xad\\ndatskaya, 2015; Raynaud and Nunan, 2014). Meanwhile, soil chemical\\nconditions can drastically change over a short distance in soil (Raynaud\\nand Nunan, 2014). Aggregation contributes to heterogeneity in soils by\\ngoverning oxygen, water and nutrient availability and shapes microbial\\ncommunities living inside or at the interface of aggregates (Briar et al.,\\n2011). Furthermore, soil microbial communities can quickly respond to\\nlocal habitat shifts associated with changes in soil aggregation dynamics\\n(Blaud et al., 2012). A better understanding of the interaction between\\nsoil amendments, soil aggregate dynamics, and aggregate-associated soil\\nmicrobial communities can inform management strategies to enhance\\nsoil biological activity and a range of desired soil functions.\\nMost large-scale agricultural systems have moved away from organic\\namendments with increasing reliance on synthetic fertilizers. Soil\\ndegradation, erosion, and soil organic matter loss are unfortunate con\\xad\\nsequences from the paucity of organic inputs that are common in con\\xad\\nventional agricultural production (Lehman et al., 2015). For this reason,\\na variety of organic amendments such as compost (Diacono and Mon\\xad\\ntemurro, 2011), animal manures (Mikha and Rice, 2004), and biochar\\n(Atkinson et al., 2010) are being considered once again, and studies\\ncomparing their impacts on soils managed with synthetic fertilizer that\\ndominate today are critically needed.\\nSoil organic amendments can enhance soil C storage through mul\\xad\\n\\ntiple mechanisms; these include increasing soil microbial biomass and\\nactivity (Liang et al., 2017), enhancing soil water-stable aggregation\\n(Mpeketula and Snapp, 2019), and introducing recalcitrant C (Smith,\\n2016). Biochar is typically applied only once every few years (Major,\\n2010), while the application of manure-based compost tends to be more\\nfrequent (Larney and Angers, 2012), both to provide sufficient macroand micronutrients for plants (Diacono and Montemurro, 2011) and\\nsupport soil microbial communities (Kuzyakov and Blagodatskaya,\\n2015). Biochar has received considerable attention regarding its po\\xad\\ntential to increase soil carbon pools (Smith, 2016). Biomass feedstock\\ncomposition, pyrolysis conditions and soil properties, such as clay con\\xad\\ntent, can impact biochar stability (Wang et al., 2016b). Relatively higher\\npyrolysis temperatures, longer reaction residence time and slow heating\\nare favorable pyrolysis conditions for generating more recalcitrant\\nbiochar with longer half-life (Leng and Huang, 2018), which was\\nconsidered to have greater potential to increase the stable soil carbon\\npool. Biochar has been observed to have both positive and negative\\npriming effects in both lab and field-scale studies and previous _meta-_\\nanalyses indicated that biochar application commonly induced a rela\\xad\\ntively short-term positive priming effect initially, followed by a negative\\npriming effect (Joseph et al., 2021). Biochar containing labile C boosted\\nsoil microbial activities (Zimmerman et al., 2011) and biochar-induced\\nmicrobial nutrient mining (Zhu et al., 2021) can generate positive\\npriming effects. Biochar can also cause negative priming effects over a\\nlonger time period by substrate switching from biochar labile C to the\\nuse of soil organic carbon (Ventura et al., 2019) and substrate dilution\\n\\n\\n(Whitman et al., 2014). Biochar C/N ratio, pyrolysis time, soil clay\\ncontent, and soil C/N ratio affect the magnitude of the negative priming\\neffect (Ding et al., 2018).\\nUnder field conditions, biochar particles experience a decrease in\\ntheir bioavailablity through association with clay particles and soil\\norganic matter (Lehmann and Joseph, 2015). However, biochar surface\\nfunctional groups may become exposed during its aging, which would\\nthen increase biochar-microbe interactions (Wang et al., 2020). Unlike\\nhighly recalcitrant biochar, compost and cover crops contain a higher\\nvariety and concentration of biologically-available nutrients that can be\\nmetabolized by microbes (Diacono and Montemurro, 2010). Soil waterstable aggregate dynamics driven largely by soil microbes play an\\nessential role in soil C sequestration (Joseph C Blankinship et al., 2016).\\nIn a meta-analysis, Islam et al. (2021) reported that biochar properties,\\nsoil and environmental conditions all contributed to the impact of bio\\xad\\nchar on soil aggregation, while wood-sourced and high-temperature\\nbiochar were found to have the greatest effect on aggregation. The\\nlong-term effects of the combined application of compost and biochar on\\nsoil water-stable aggregate dynamics and C sequestration under field\\nconditions remain understudied, especially in annual Mediteranean\\nagroecosystems.\\nThe objective of our study was to investigate the effects of two fer\\xad\\n\\ntiliser treatments, namely poultry manure compost and mineral fertil\\xad\\nizer, each with and without biochar, on soil water-stable soil\\naggregation, aggregate-associated C storage, and soil microbial com\\xad\\nmunity composition and abundance. We hypothesized that: (1) annual\\ncompost addition will increase soil C storage, (2) one-time highly\\nrecalcitrant biochar-C input will increase soil C storage, (3) multiple and\\ncontinuous compost addition will increase soil microbial biomass in bulk\\nsoil and alter microbial community composition across aggregate frac\\xad\\ntions, and (4) compost amendments will increase soil aggregation and\\nassociated soil C storagecompared tounamended soil receiving only\\nmineral fertilizer. To test these hypotheses, we compared the impacts of\\ndifferent fertility management practices and biochar amendment in a 6year tilled, row crop field trial in northern California, representative of\\nan annual Mediterranean agroecosystem.\\n\\n**2. Material and methods**\\n\\n_2.1. Long-term field trial setup_\\n\\nThe field site is located at the Russell Ranch Sustainable Agricultural\\nResearch Facility, University of California, Davis (Davis, California,\\nUSA; 38[◦]32[′]47[′′]N 121[◦]52[′]28[′′]W). The region has a Mediterranean\\nclimate characterized by dry arid summers and wet winters. The soil is a\\nRincon silty clay loam (fine, smectitic, thermic Mollic Haploxeralfs, 20%\\nsand, 49% silt, and 31% clay; 11 g C kg[−][1]C content; 1.30 g cm[−][3 ] bulk\\ndensity).\\nA field experiment was initiated in May of 2012 to investigate the\\nimpacts of soil amendments (poultry manure compost, biochar, and\\nmineral fertilizer) on soil aggregation, C storage, and microbial com\\xad\\nmunities in aggregate size fractions. The field was kept fallow for 10\\nyears before 2012, except for a season of Montezuma oats grown be\\xad\\ntween October 2009 and March 2010. The cropping system consisted of\\na 2-yr rotation of processing tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.)\\nand corn (Zea mays L.). The farm management was based on practices\\nand equipment similar to that used by local commercial growers. Bio\\xad\\nchar was applied once to half of the plots at the start of the experiment at\\na rate of 10 Mg ha[−][1 ] and disked in to a depth of 15 cm. The applied\\nbiochar was a by-product of gasification (pyrolysis temperature of\\n900 [◦]C) derived from walnut shells and produced by Dixon Ridge Farms\\nin Winters, CA (with 57.5 m[2 ]g[−][1 ]surface area, 40.4% ash content, 33.4\\ncmol g[−][1 ]cation exchange capacity, pH of 9.7, 55.3 wt% C, 0.47 wt% N,\\n0.89 wt% H, 1.6 wt% O, 0.64 wt% PO4-P, 9.32 wt% K; see Mukome et al.\\n(2013) for details). Additionally, two fertility management systems were\\ntested with equivalent total N inputs, based on either: i) mineral\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nfertilizer (27.6 kg N ha[−][1 ]as urea-ammonium-nitrate 32 (UAN-32), 36.2\\nkg P ha[−][1]P as phosphorus pentoxide, 17.2 kg K ha[−][1 ]as potassium oxide,\\nand 1.7 kg ha[−][1 ] of zinc chelate as starter fertilizer applied before\\nplanting each season; UAN-32 was applied at a rate of 134.5 kg N ha[−][1 ]\\n\\nthree weeks after tomato transplanting and at a rate of 207.4 kg N ha[−][1 ]\\n\\nat the four-leaf growth stage in corn), or ii) poultry manure compost\\n(8.97 Mg ha[−][1 ]applied yearly, adding on average 225.4 kg ha[−][1 ]total N,\\n119.5 kg ha[−][1 ] total P, and 155.4 kg ha[−][1 ] total K; including an incor\\xad\\nporated winter cover crop for the first four years) (Griffin et al., 2017).\\nThis resulted in four treatments: 1) mineral fertilizer without biochar; 2)\\nmineral fertilizer with biochar; 3) compost without biochar; and 4)\\ncompost with biochar, arranged in a randomized complete block design\\nwith four replicate blocks per treatment and one treatment replicate per\\nblock, making a total of 16 plots (Fig. S1). Each replicate plot was 4.6 m\\nwide and 50 m long.\\nThe average annual above-ground C input in the mineral fertilizer\\ntreatment without biochar was 4.30 Mg C ha[−][1 ]year[−][1 ]as crop residue.\\nBased on calculations for the adjacent Century Experiment at Russell\\nRanch that includes crop rotations with identical compost and cover\\ncrop management, the compost without biochar treatment received an\\naverage annual input of 7.27 Mg C ha[−][1 ]year[−][1 ]for the first 4 years and\\n6.52 Mg C ha[−][1 ]year[−][1 ]for the remaining duration of the experiment, of\\nwhich approximately 2.22 Mg C ha[−][1 ]year[−][1 ]was accounted for by the\\ncompost amendment (Tautges et al., 2019). The biochar-amended\\ntreatments both received 5.53 Mg C ha[−][1 ]as biochar-C (only in Year 1)\\nin addition to the carbon inputs above.\\n\\n_2.2. Soil water-stable aggregate analysis_\\n\\nWater-stable aggregates were separated by size using a wet-sieving\\nmethod adapted from (Elliott, 1986). In March 2014 and March 2018,\\nthree soil sub-samples were taken to a depth 15 cm from each field\\nreplicate using a soil knife and combined into a single representative soil\\nsample. The field-moist soils were passed through an 8 mm sieve by\\ngently breaking the soil clods by hand along natural planes of weakness.\\nA 50 g sample of the moist, 8 mm sieved soil was then submerged in\\ndeionized water (at room temperature) on top of a 2000 μm sieve for 5\\nmin. The sieve was then moved up and down (~3 cm) for 2 min (50\\nrepetitions min[−][1]). The soil and water passing through the sieve were\\ntransferred by gently rinsing the material with deionized water onto the\\nnext smaller size sieve, and the same sieving procedure was repeated.\\nThree sieve sizes (2000 μm, 250 μm and 53 μm) were used to generate\\nfour aggregate size fractions: 1) > 2000 μm (large macroaggregates); 2)\\n250–2000 μm (small macroaggregates); 3) 53–250 μm (micro\\xad\\naggregates); 4) < 53 μm (silt and clay fraction). Two independent rounds\\nof sieving were performed. First, one set of samples were obtained to\\nquantify water-stable aggregates and conduct physicochemical analyses,\\nin which all the aggregate fractions retained on each sieve were rinsed\\noff the sieve in pre-weighed aluminum pans, oven-dried at 60 [◦]C, and\\nthen weighed. The other set of samples was obtained for analysis of\\nmicrobial community composition and abundance. The large and small\\nmacroaggregates and microaggregates retained on each sieve were\\nrinsed off the sieve into sterile 50 mL polypropylene tubes. The silt and\\nclay fraction was allowed to settle for a few minutes, and then sub\\xad\\nsamples of both sediment and supernatant were collected in a 50 mL\\nsterile tube. All the aggregate size fractions were immediately stored at\\n−80 [◦]C until DNA extraction.\\nMean weight diameter (MWD), an index of aggregate stability based\\non a weighted average of the four aggregate size classes, was calculated\\naccording to the following equation (Van Bavel, 1950):\\nwhere Pi is the weight percentage of the fraction in the whole soil and\\nSi is the average diameter (μm) for particles in its fraction.\\n\\n_2.3. C content and its change over time_\\n\\nThe C content of bulk soils and of each aggregate size fraction was\\n\\n\\nanalyzed using a PDZ Europa ANCA-GSL elemental analyzer interfaced\\nto a PDZ Europa 20–20 isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Sercon Ltd.,\\nCheshire, UK) at the UC Davis Stable Isotope Facility.\\n\\n_2.4. Soil dissolved organic C and microbial biomass C_\\n\\nThe fresh soil collected in March 2018 was also used to evaluate the\\nimpacts of different soil management treatments on soil dissolved\\norganic C and soil microbial biomass-C. A representative bulk soil\\nsample (8 g) was mixed with 40 mL 0.5 mol L[−][1 ] potassium sulfate in\\npolypropylene tubes and placed on an orbital shaker (250 rev min[−][1], 30\\nmin). After shaking, samples were centrifuged (relative centrifugal force\\nof 7969 × g for 15 min) to remove suspended solids. Supernatant so\\xad\\nlutions were retained for dissolved organic C concentrations (mg L[−][1]).\\nThe total microbial biomass-C was measured by chloroform fumigation\\n(Joergensen, 1996; Yang et al., 2016). Both soil dissolved organic C and\\nmicrobial biomass-C were measured using a TOC analyzer (Shimadzu\\nTOC-VCSH analyzer, Kyoto, KYT, Japan).\\n\\n_2.5. Soil DNA extraction from aggregate fractions and amplicon_\\n_sequencing_\\n\\nDNA from each soil aggregate size fraction was extracted using the\\nPowerlyzer PowerSoil DNA Isolation kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD,\\nUSA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The extracted DNA\\nwas quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit (Life Technologies,\\nCarlsbad, CA, USA). The V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S\\nrRNA gene was amplified from each sample in duplicate using the\\nprimer pair 505F/816R (Caporaso et al., 2012), which was designed to\\ninclude Illumina adaptors and 12 bp barcode sequences. The resulting\\namplicons were inspected by gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel,\\nquantified by fluorimetry as above, pooled in equimolar concentrations,\\nand sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform (paired-end 250 bp) at the\\nUC Davis DNA Technologies core facility. The raw reads were processed\\nusing DADA2 (Callahan et al., 2016) implemented in R v.3.4.4. Briefly,\\npaired-end fastq files were processed by quality-trimming forward and\\nreverse reads to 190 and 150 bp lengths, respectively. After sequence\\ndereplication, merging, error-correction, and chimera removal, Exact\\nSequence Variants (ESVs) were inferred and taxonomy was assigned\\nusing the SILVA database v. 132. After quality control, the number of\\nsequences per sample varied from 14,596 to 44,786, with an average of\\n28,724. The resulting ESV abundance table was rarified to 14,000 se\\xad\\nquences per sample to ensure equal sampling depth for statistical anal\\xad\\nysis. The Functional Annotation of Prokaryotic Taxa (FAPROTAX)\\npipeline (Louca et al., 2016) was used to predict the functional potential\\nof bacterial taxa identified in our dataset. Raw sequences were deposited\\nat the NCBI sequence read archive (SRA) under BioProject accession\\nnumber PRJNA644905.\\n\\n_2.6. Quantitative PCR_\\n\\nTo assess prokaryotic and fungal gene copy number as a proxy for\\nabsolute abundance, quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed on each\\nDNA sample using the universal primers 515F (5[′]GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3[′]) and 806R (5[′]-GGAC\\xad\\n\\nTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3[′]) for the 16S rRNA gene (Rubin et al., 2014)\\nand ITS1F (5[′]-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA-3[′]) and ITS2 (5[′]GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC-3[′]) for the fungal Internal Transcribed\\nSpacer (ITS) region (De Beeck et al., 2014). qPCR was performed in 20\\nμL reaction mixtures containing 10 μL SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR\\nGreen Supermix (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA), 0.5 μM each primer, and\\n10 ng sample DNA. Reactions were carried out on a BioRad CFX Connect\\nSystem (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA) and amplification of the 16S rRNA\\ngene consisted of an initial denaturation of 95 [◦]C for 3 min, followed by\\n39 cycles of 95 [◦]C for 10 s and 60 [◦]C for 30 s. Amplification of the ITS\\nregion consisted of an initial denaturation of 95 [◦]C for 3 min, followed\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nby 39 cycles of 95 [◦]C for 10 s, 50 [◦]C for 30 s, and 72 [◦]C for 10 s.\\nQuantification was performed by comparing unknown samples to a\\nstandard curve (ranging from 10[2]-10[9 ] copies for 16S rRNA; 10[1]-10[8 ]\\n\\ncopies for ITS) generated with the pCR Blunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen,\\nCarlsbad, CA, USA) containing a PCR-amplified fragment of each target.\\nR[2 ] values for the standard curves ranged from 0.982 to 0.986 and\\n0.991–0.994 for the 16S rRNA gene and ITS region, respectively. Trip\\xad\\nlicate reactions were performed for each target per sample, and a\\nmelting curve analysis was performed after each assay to ensure speci\\xad\\nficity of the amplified products. The abundance of total 16S rRNA and\\nITS were normalized as copies per gram of soil aggregate fraction.\\n16S rRNA and ITS abundances of the bulk soil were estimated based\\non soil aggregation and copy numbers according to the following\\nequation:\\nwhere is the copy number of the target for each soil aggregate frac\\xad\\n\\ntion, and Pi is the weight percentage of the soil aggregate fraction in the\\nwhole soil, respectively, as above.\\n\\n_2.7. Statistical analyses_\\n\\nAll soil physicochemical data were analyzed in Microsoft Excel for\\nWindows 2010 with XLSTAT Version 2019.1 (Addinsoft, 2019) and\\nwere tested for assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance.\\nStatistically significant differences between treatments were analyzed\\nusing a mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) with biochar and\\nfertility management considered as fixed effects and block was a random\\neffect followed by a Tukey’s range test. Statistical analyses were per\\xad\\nformed seperately for years 2014 and 2018 to avoid the potential con\\xad\\nfounding effects of soil moisture on the soil aggregation results and other\\nresults associated with aggregate fractions.\\nNon-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) plots were generated\\nbased on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities to visualize differences in bacterial\\ncommunity composition from our 16S rRNA sequences. Differences in\\nbacterial community composition were tested by permutational multi\\xad\\nvariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) with the ‘adonis’ function\\n(Oksanen et al., 2007) in R v.3.4.4 using Bray-Curtis dissimilarities and\\nmanagement practice, biochar treatment, and aggregate size fraction as\\npredictor variables. All other microbial data, including FAPROTAX\\ncounts and qPCR values were tested for assumptions of normality and\\nhomogeneity of variance before performing ANOVA and a Tukey HSD\\npost-hoc test to identify significant differences between treatments, with\\nbiochar and fertility management considered as main effects, block\\nincluded as a random variable and aggregate fractions nested within\\n\\n\\neach plot replicate. Natural log transformations were applied to meet the\\nassumptions of ANOVA (normality, homoscedasticity) when necessary.\\nFor all analyses, statistically significant differences were defined at P <\\n0.05.\\n\\n**3. Results**\\n\\n_3.1. Soil water-stable aggregates_\\n\\nCompost amended soil had significantly higher aggregate stability\\ncompared to mineral fertilizer treatments after six years, such that in\\nMarch 2018, the MWD of soils managed with compost was 140% higher\\nthan those receiving mineral fertilizer (Fig. 1). Compost application\\nmaintained water-stable aggregation, in which the soil MWD in March\\n2018 remained the same as that in March 2014, while the mineral fer\\xad\\ntilizer treatments significantly decreased by ~48% over the four years\\n(Fig. 1). The observed loss in aggregation under mineral fertilizer was\\nprimarily due to a significant loss in large macroaggregates (Table 1).\\nNeither fertility management nor biochar amendment had a significant\\nshort-term (two years, in March 2014) effect on soil structure (Fig. 1a).\\nBiochar amendment had no long-term effect on soil MWD under either\\nfertilizer treatment (Fig. 1b).\\n\\n_3.2. Soil C content and C in aggregate fractions_\\n\\nCompost application resulted in significantly higher bulk soil C\\ncontent compared to the mineral fertilizer treatment. After six years of\\ncompost amendment in 2018, the C content in the top 15 cm of soil was\\n12.4 g C kg[−][1]whole soil, which was 17% higher than the mineral fer\\xad\\ntilizer treatment (Fig. 2) and due largely to an increase in the large\\nmacroaggregate associated C (Table 2). This was in contrast to early in\\nthe trial, where two years of compost addition did not significantly affect\\nbulk soil C content in 2014 (Fig. 2a). Surprisingly, the 10 Mg ha[−][1 ]\\n\\nbiochar amendment had no long-term effect on soil C content or C dis\\xad\\ntribution across aggregate fractions under either fertility management\\npractice after six years (Fig. 2 and Table 2).\\n\\n_3.3. Soil dissolved organic C and microbial biomass-C_\\n\\nCompost addition significantly increased both soil dissolved organic\\nC and soil microbial biomass C compared to the mineral fertilizer\\ntreatment. Soil dissolved organic C contents in compost treatments were\\n174.6 mg C kg[−][1 ]in the whole soil after 6 years, which was 54% higher\\n\\n\\n**Fig. 1.

Similar differences were\\nalso observed in soil microbial biomass C, which was 315.2 mg C kg[−][1 ]\\n\\nwhole soil in compost, approximately two times as in mineral fertilizer\\ntreatments (Fig. 3b). Similar to total soil C, dissolved organic C and\\nmicrobial biomass C were not influenced by an initial application of\\nbiochar under either treatment in 2018.\\n\\n_3.4. Soil microbial community composition and abundance in water-_\\n_stable aggregate fractions_\\n\\nCompost management significantly increased both bacterial 16S\\nrRNA gene and fungal ITS abundances across soil water-stable aggregate\\nfractions, while biochar had no effect in year 2018 (Figs. 4 and 5). The\\nweighted average gene abundance in bulk soil also indicated that the\\nabundance of the 16S rRNA gene was 76% higher under compost than in\\nsoils receiving mineral fertilizer (Fig. 6a). The weighted average ITS\\ncopy number in bulk soil under compost addition was two orders of\\nmagnitudes higher than in soil under mineral fertilizer treatment\\n(Fig. 6b). Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis of the\\n16 s rRNA gene at the ESV level revealed that soil prokaryotic com\\xad\\nmunity composition was significantly distinct in aggregate fractions of\\ndifferent sizes (Fig. 7). These differences were reflected by higher pro\\xad\\nportions of bacteria from the orders _Micrococcales,_ _Streptomycetales,_\\n_Propionibacteriales, and Sphingomonadales in the microaggregate and silt_\\nand clay fractions, and higher proportions of the _Gaiellales,_ _Gemmati\\xad_\\n_monadales,_ _Nitrososphaerales, and_ _Nitrospirales_ in the large and small\\naggregate fractions. Across all aggregate size fractions, both compost\\nand mineral fertilizer treatments had significant but limited effects on\\nbacterial community composition, whereas biochar had no effect\\n(Fig. S2).\\nPredictive assignment of soil microbial functions based on the 16S\\nrRNA gene sequencing results revealed that the abundance of bacteria\\npotentially capable of degrading aromatic C compounds was higher in\\ncompost than mineral fertilizer treatments in 2018 (Fig. 8). No differ\\xad\\nences were detected for predicted functions related to many major C\\n(methanotrophy, methylotrophy, chitinolysis, cellulolysis, xylanolysis,\\nnon-methane aliphatic hydrocarbon degradation, hydrocarbon degra\\xad\\ndation) and N (aerobic ammonia oxidation, aerobic nitrite oxidation,\\nnitrification, nitrate reduction, ureolysis) cycling pathways between the\\ntwo treatments.\\n\\n\\n**4. Discussion**\\n\\n_4.1. Impacts of external C inputs on soil C storage_\\n\\nOur findings suggest that continuous compost application is more\\neffective at increasing soil C sequestration by maintaining soil structure\\nand stabilizing SOM than in soils not receiving compost. In contrast,\\nwithout compost inputs, there were significant decreases in aggregate\\nstructure, which in turn was associated with significant C loss. Poultry\\nmanure compost is rich in multivalent ions, such as Ca and P (Griffin\\net al., 2017), which can generate a bridging effect to enhance sorption of\\nSOM to clay minerals (Feng et al., 2005) and increase soil aggregation\\n(Bronick and Lal, 2005). The lack of sufficient C input and associated\\naggregate structure in the mineral fertilizer treatments could lead to\\ngreater exposure and more rapid decay of native SOM (Dungait et al.,\\n2012).\\nSurprisingly, walnut shell biochar had little effect on soil C in the top\\n15 cm. Previous research has hypothesized that recalcitrant C com\\xad\\npounds are the major contributors to C sequestration from biochar\\n(Cheng et al., 2008; Harvey et al., 2012), especially high-temperature\\nbiochars like the type applied in our study, which has a high propor\\xad\\ntion of recalcitrant to labile C (Zimmerman, 2010). The O/C and H/C\\natom ratios of the walnut shell biochar were 0.0217 and 0.193,\\nrespectively (Mukome et al., 2013a), which indicated that the walnut\\nshell biochar-C was relatively stable and potentially had a longer than\\n1000-year half-life (Spokas, 2010). A large amount of biochar particles\\n(with a diameter of around 2–4 mm) was easily observed and recovered\\nin the surface soil at the end of the field trial. We did not detect soil bulk\\nC content difference between no-biochar and biochar-amended treat\\xad\\nments under the same management practice in either year 2 or year 6\\n(Fig. 2), which indicated a positive priming effect at the beginning of the\\nfield trial. The walnut shell biochar was high in potassium ion (Mukome\\net al., 2013b). The increase in soil monovalent ion concentration can\\nenhance mobility of soluble SOM and dispersion of organic matter and\\nclay particles (Chow et al., 2006), which can both result in a short-term\\npositive priming effect due to increased microbial available substrates\\nand microbial activities (DeCiucies et al., 2018). A 14-month lab incu\\xad\\nbation study using similar soil and the same biochar (with application\\nrates equivalent or doubled as in the field study) also showed evidence of\\npositive priming effect and potential soil native organic C loss within the\\ntimeframe of the incubation (Wang et al., 2017).

Different colors and symbols represent different water-stable aggre\\xad\\ngate fractions.\\n\\n\\ncompost-amended than mineral fertilizer treatments. Compost also\\ncontains a diverse range of C sources for soil microbes (Barker, 1997),\\nand its addition helped maintain higher soil labile C (Fig. 3a) and mi\\xad\\ncrobial biomass (Fig. 3b) compared to in the mineral fertilizer treat\\xad\\nments. The compost-induced increase in soil microbial biomass also\\ncorroborated our findings of increased 16S rRNA gene and ITS copy\\nnumbers across aggregate size fractions (Figs. 4 and 5) and in weighted\\nbulk soil averages (Fig. 6). Compost amendment enhanced soil aggre\\xad\\ngation by providing a large amount of labile C (Amlinger et al., 2003) as\\nfeedstock for microbes to produce extracellular polymeric substances,\\nwhich can serve as binding agents for soil aggregates (J C Blankinship\\net al., 2016; Miltner et al., 2012). The increased fungal biomass (Figs. 5\\nand 6) can also promote soil aggregation by binding and entangling soil\\nparticles to form macroaggregate structure (Van Der Heijden et al.,\\n2006). Enhanced soil aggregation provides more diverse habitats for\\norganisms, which can lead to increases in soil microbial diversity (Briar\\net al., 2011). Furthermore, the soil aggregate structure can enhance the\\ninteractions within microbial consortia responsible for metabolizing\\n\\n\\ncomplex organic compounds (Wilpiszeski et al., 2019). The shift we\\nobserved in bacterial communities in different aggregate size fractions\\n(Fig. 7) provides evidence for the paradigm that unique aggregate mi\\xad\\ncroenvironments can provide niches to support the development of\\ndistinct microbial communities, which can further benefit soil and\\necosystem properties (Bach et al., 2018; Wilpiszeski et al., 2019).\\nAcross all aggregate size fractions, we also observed distinct differ\\xad\\n\\nences in prokaryotic community compositions between compost and\\nmineral fertilizer treatments (Fig. S2). Previous research investigating a\\nsimilar soil (Yolo silt loam) from a field adjacent to this trial indicated\\nthat the dissolved organic matter from the soil in our field trial was\\nhighly aromatic (Wang et al., 2016a). Our FAPROTAX predictive results\\nalso indicated a higher abundance of bacteria potentially capable of\\ndegrading aromatic C compounds in compost treatments (Fig. 8), which\\nsuggests that microbial communities under continuous compost appli\\xad\\ncation are potentially capable of utilizing a wider range of C sources\\nfrom both soil amendments and native soil organic matter, which further\\nenriched soil microbially-available nutrients. Such feedback can\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Fig. 8.

Other soil C and N cycling pathways did not show\\ndifferences since the sampling time was 300 days after the yearly\\ncompost amendment.\\nCompost application may have increased macroaggregate formation\\nby maintaining higher fungal populations across aggregate fractions.\\nAlthough both bacteria and fungi populations were higher in the\\ncompost than mineral fertilizer treatments (Figs. 5 and 6), the difference\\nin fungal abundance was two orders of magnitudes higher in compost\\nthan mineral fertilizer treatments (Fig. 6b). Higher fungal biomass\\ndensity has been linked with increased soil aggregate formation (Leh\\xad\\nmann et al., 2020) and fungi have been suggested to contribute more\\nthan prokaryotic communities to macroaggregate formation due to the\\nenmeshing properties of their hyphae (Lehmann et al., 2017). The major\\ndifference in aggregation between the mineral fertilizer and compost\\ntreatments was due to the loss of large-macroaggregates under mineral\\nfertilizer (Table 1), which suggested that the differences in fungal\\ncommunity abundance could have been a major contributor to the\\nobserved differences in soil structure. Similar to our finding, Li et al.\\n(2019) in a long-term field study in Guizhou, China, reported that soil\\nfungal abundances across aggregate fractions were maintained when\\nmineral fertilizer was supplemented with manure but decreased in the\\nabsence of amendments; aggregate-associated C content also declined.\\nIncreased macroaggregate structure in compost treatments can, in turn,\\nenhance the resistance of soil microbial habitats to environmental dis\\xad\\nturbances (Rillig et al., 2017). Our results support the hypothesis that\\nimpacts of management practices on soil C are dependent on changes in\\nsoil aggregation and aggregate-associated microbial communities\\n(Trivedi et al., 2017). As shown in Table S1 and summarized in Griffin\\net al. (2017), despite the benefits associated with soil aggregation and C\\ndynamics, crop yield in compost treatments were significantly lower\\nthan those in mineral fertilizer treatments due to the uncertainty of ni\\xad\\ntrogen availability in compost amended soil and the asynchronous ni\\xad\\ntrogen supply and demand, which is a common tradeoff for similar\\npractices (Seufert et al., 2012).\\nInterstingly, we found no effect of walnut shell biochar on soil\\n\\n\\nmicrobial community composition or any soil parameters in our study,\\nunlike what has been observed in previous studies investigating at other\\ntypes of biochar (Jiang et al., 2016; Khodadad et al., 2011; Zhu et al.,\\n2019). This may be due to the differences in biochar feedstock, pyrolysis\\nconditions, soil and other environmental factors, or the fact that biochar\\nunder field conditions behaves differently than in the lab (Islam et al.,\\n2021). It is possible that biochars produced at high temperatures\\n(900 [◦]C) contain little labile organic C compared to low temperature\\nbiochar and hence are not capable of supporting growth of microbial\\npopulations. Another explanation for the lack of impact may be the\\nlimited accessibility of biochar pores to microbes, despite its relatively\\nhigh surface area and pore volume (Mukome et al., 2013a). The inter\\xad\\nparticle pore structure in biochar is rapidly filled by soil particles after\\naddition to soil (Lehmann and Joseph, 2015). Joseph et al. (2010) found\\nthat biochar internal pores started to fill in with organic and mineral\\nmatter after 1 year and most pores were filled 2 years after application in\\na field experiment. Ameloot et al. (2014) also found that biochar stopped\\nserving as microbial substrate soon after application (~60 days) and had\\nlittle long-term impact on soil microbial biomass and activities under\\nfield conditions. While previous studies have shown that biochar can\\nalter soil microbial communities and potentially increase microbial in\\xad\\nteractions, most of these studies have been conducted in highly weath\\xad\\nered oxisols with limited impacts observed in soils with high fertility (Yu\\net al., 2018). We speculate that soil amendments with higher amounts of\\nnon-pyrolyzed and/or microbially-available organic C can help achieve\\nagricultural management targets, such as enhancing soil aggregation\\nand C storage more effectively.\\n\\n**5. Conclusion**\\n\\nOur findings indicate that continuous compost amendment can\\npotentially generate a positive feedback loop for soil aggregate forma\\xad\\ntion and associated C storage by maintaining higher dissolved organic C\\ncontent, increasing microbial biomass, and supporting largemacroaggregate formation. These processes, in turn, promote the abil\\xad\\nity of the microbial community to utilize more diverse C sources. In finetextured soil, biochar had a limited impact on the soil microbial\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\ncommunity, soil aggregation, and C dynamics, likely due to low mi\\xad\\ncrobial available C and limited interaction with the environment. Longterm continuous diversified C source amendment, such as adding\\ncompost, could be an effective agricultural management practice to not\\nonly maintain but increase soil microbial biomass, aggregate formation,\\nand soil C storage, and also replace some mineral fertilizer which could\\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with fertilizer production.\\nAn integrated management practice that carefully balances compost and\\nmineral fertilizer composition can potentially balance the benefits and\\ntradeoffs.\\n\\n**Declaration of Competing Interest**\\n\\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial\\ninterests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence\\nthe work reported in this paper.\\n\\n**Data availability**\\n\\nData will be made available on request.\\n\\n**Acknowledgments**\\n\\nWe thank Israel Herrera, Deirdre Griffin-LaHue, Nicole Tautges,\\nmembers of the Scow Soil Microbial Ecology Lab, and staff at Russell\\nRanch Sustainable Agriculture Facility in University of California, Davis,\\nfor their valuable support in our field study.
